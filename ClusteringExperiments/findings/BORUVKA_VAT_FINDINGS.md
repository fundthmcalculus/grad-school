# Spike: Borůvka parallel MST for VAT — findings

**Question:** can a parallel MST (Borůvka) speed up VAT/iVAT, where the serial
Prim round-loop is the inherently-sequential core?

## The key observation (why the output is *exact*, not approximate)

VAT's ordering is Prim's vertex-insertion order, and by the cut property Prim
only ever traverses **MST edges**. So we can build the MST by *any* method and
then run Prim **restricted to the MST tree** from the same seed (the
global-maximum-dissimilarity vertex) to reproduce the exact VAT ordering — and
hence the exact iVAT image. Parallel VAT therefore reduces to **parallel MST +
an O(n log n) tree traversal**, with no approximation.

Confirmed: the Borůvka-derived VAT order matches serial Prim's on every tested
size (`order_match = 1.0000`), and the iVAT images are bit-identical
(`max |serial − Borůvka| = 0.0`).

## CPU Borůvka — a modest, eroding win

Borůvka does O(n² log n) work (O(log n) rounds, each an O(n²) min-outgoing-edge
scan) — a log factor *more* than serial compact-Prim's O(n²) — so it can only
win by parallelism. On 32 cores (Numba) the parallel min-edge scan beats the
(already highly optimized) serial C/OpenMP Prim at small–mid n, but the extra
log-factor work erodes the lead as n grows (≈1.4× at n=8000, tied by n≈32000).

## Real device-side GPU Borůvka (the follow-through)

A first *naive* CuPy port (per-round `n×n` mask + host union-find) was 3–8×
**slower** — allocation- and host-sync-bound. Replacing it with a real
device-side implementation (`experiments/boruvka_gpu.py`) changes the picture.
Every round runs on the GPU:

1. **`min_out_edge`** — one block per row; threads scan the row *coalesced* and
   block-reduce to each vertex's minimum edge leaving its component.
2. **`reduce_minw` / `pick_vertex`** — per-component `atomicMin` on the
   monotonic `u64` bit-cast of the (non-negative) weight, then `atomicMin` on
   the vertex index to break ties deterministically. No `n×n` temporaries.
3. **`hook`** — each root hooks to its neighbour's component; mutual 2-cycles
   resolved so the shared edge is emitted once (atomic edge counter).
4. **`relabel` + sync-free pointer-jumping** — parallel union-find on-device;
   only one scalar (edge count) crosses to the host per round.

Still **exact**: valid spanning tree, MST weight equal to the CPU MST, VAT order
match `1.0000`, iVAT image diff `0.0` at every tested size.

MST build time (ms), and speedup of the device-resident GPU vs serial Prim:

| n | serial Prim | Borůvka Numba | **GPU (resident)** | GPU (+transfer) | GPU speedup |
|-----|------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 2000 | 3.1 | 0.9 | **1.4** | 8.6 | 2.2× |
| 4000 | 16.0 | 11.4 | **4.0** | 28.8 | 4.0× |
| 8000 | 94.9 | 48.8 | **12.5** | 119.8 | 7.6× |
| 16000 | 222.3 | 191.5 | **42.7** | 316.7 | 5.2× |
| 32000 | 901.5 | 914.6 | **180.6** | 1938.2 | 5.0× |

![scaling](../figures/boruvka_vat_scaling.png)

The device-resident GPU Borůvka is a **solid ~5× win that does NOT erode with n**
(the GPU has the memory bandwidth for the repeated O(n²) scans that O(n²·log n)
demands) — the opposite of the CPU Numba curve, which ties serial Prim by
n=32000. The dashed line is the catch: **including the host→device transfer of
the `n×n` matrix, the GPU loses** (transfer dominates, exactly as for GPU
pairwise distances).

## DGX Spark (GB10): unified memory dissolves the transfer wall

The numbers above were on a discrete GPU, where the dashed "+transfer" line is
the whole story: copying the `n×n` matrix over PCIe cost ~10× the resident
kernel and sank the GPU for host-resident data. Re-running on an **NVIDIA DGX
Spark (GB10 Grace-Blackwell)** — where the CPU and GPU share ~128 GB of coherent
LPDDR5X over NVLink-C2C — changes the conclusion in two ways.

**1. The transfer tax collapses (10.7× → ~3×), and unified memory nearly erases
it.** GB10's GPU is smaller than the discrete card, so the *device-resident*
kernel is a touch slower in absolute ms — but the copy penalty is far cheaper,
and allocating the matrix in **CUDA managed (unified) memory** removes the
explicit copy altogether. MST build time (ms), same blobs, `experiments/boruvka_dgx_spark.py`:

| n | serial Prim | Borůvka Numba | GPU resident | GPU **unified** (no copy) | GPU host+copy |
|------|------------|---------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| 2000 | 3.6 | 1.2 | 1.1 | **1.6** | 3.0 |
| 4000 | 13.5 | 9.9 | 3.7 | **5.1** | 10.5 |
| 8000 | 52.6 | 35.6 | 13.5 | **19.1** | 44.0 |
| 16000 | 202.8 | 138.2 | 53.4 | **75.0** | 163.6 |
| 32000 | 838.8 | 612.0 | 245.7 | **349.1** | 726.4 |

The unified/managed input tracks device-resident within ~1.4× and is **~2.1×
faster than the explicit-copy path** (349 vs 726 ms at n=32000) — with only *one*
`n×n` allocation instead of two. It also beats CPU Numba Borůvka (2.4×) and
serial Prim (1.75×) *for host-resident data*, which the discrete GPU could not.
Still exact (MST weight parity with the CPU MST at every size).

**2. The 128 GB unified pool runs VAT MST past every discrete-GPU VRAM wall.**
A dense f64 `n×n` matrix hits 24/48/80 GB at n≈54.7k / 77.5k / 100k, so discrete
GPUs OOM there — and the old host→device path OOMs *even sooner* on GB10 because
`cp.asarray(D)` needs a second `n×n` buffer (host **and** device copy). Building
the matrix **on the device** (tiled `pairwise_distances_gpu`, single unified
allocation) avoids the doubling and roughly doubles the reachable n:

| n | D size | GPU pairwise (one-time) | **GPU Borůvka MST** | edges |
|-------|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 16000 | 2.0 GB | 1.0 s | **75 ms** | 15999/15999 |
| 32000 | 8.2 GB | 3.1 s | **349 ms** | 31999/31999 |
| 65536 | 34.4 GB | 13.8 s | **1.46 s** | 65535/65535 |
| 100000 | 80.0 GB | 34.0 s | **3.41 s** | 99999/99999 |

n=100000 is an **80 GB** distance matrix held in the shared pool with a correct
spanning tree — a size no single discrete GPU can hold at all.

![large-n](../figures/boruvka_dgx_largen.png)

**Takeaway for GB10:** the discrete-GPU verdict's "one condition" (matrix must be
device-resident) is satisfied *for free* by unified memory — allocate the matrix
once with `boruvka_gpu.alloc_unified` / `as_unified` (or build it on-device with
`pairwise_distances_gpu`) and both the CPU distance build and the GPU MST touch
the same pages with no copy. The device-resident win survives, the transfer wall
does not, and the memory ceiling moves from tens of GB to ~128 GB.

## Precision: f32 and f16 on GB10 (~2× per step, ~4× at f16)

The `n×n` matrix *is* the memory footprint and the per-round scan is
bandwidth-bound, so narrowing the element type should both shrink the matrix and
speed the scan. The GPU Borůvka kernels were templated over three storage types
(`experiments/boruvka_gpu.py`): `TREAL` stores the matrix at f64/f32/**f16**,
while the compare/reduce type `TCOMP` and the monotonic-bit-cast key `TKEY` stay
`float`/`u32` for f16 and f32 (f16 is widened to float on load — no reliance on
16-bit atomics). Same algorithm, exact same edge-selection logic.

**Speed — a clean ~2× per precision step (matrix build time by storage dtype):**

| n | f64 | f32 | f16 | f16 vs f64 |
|-------|-------|-------|------|-----------|
| 4000 | 5.1 | 2.8 | 1.6 | 3.2× |
| 8000 | 19.2 | 9.8 | 5.2 | 3.7× |
| 16000 | 75.0 | 38.0 | 19.2 | 3.9× |
| 32000 | 349.1 | 175.5 | 88.4 | **3.9×** |

Bandwidth-bound as predicted: f32 ≈ 2× f64, f16 ≈ 2× f32 (≈4× f64).

**Accuracy vs f64** (MST weight = the low-precision MST's *chosen edges*
re-measured on the exact f64 distances; VAT `order_match` vs serial Prim):

| dtype | MST-weight reldiff | VAT order_match | iVAT image mean\|diff\| | verdict |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|---------|
| f32 | ~1e-15 (machine ε) | **1.0000** | **0.0** (bit-identical) | free lunch |
| f16 | ~1e-6 – 1e-7 | 0.95 – 0.997 | ~1e-4 (max ~2.6% of range) | near-identical |

- **f32 is a free lunch.** ~7 decimal digits is enough to preserve the exact
  edge selection: bit-identical MST, VAT order, and iVAT image as f64, at half
  the memory and ~2× the speed. There is no reason to use f64 on GB10.
- **f16 is near-identical, not exact.** The spanning tree it builds is still
  within ~1e-6 of the optimal MST weight, but f16's ~3-digit precision flips a
  small fraction of *near-tie* edges, which perturbs a few percent of the VAT
  order positions. The iVAT image tracks f64 in the **mean** (~1e-4) — the
  cluster block structure is visually identical — with a handful of pixels off
  by up to ~2.6% of range. Good for exploratory cluster-tendency at extreme
  scale; not for a bit-exact reproduction of the serial engine.

![precision](../figures/boruvka_dgx_precision.png)

**Capacity — narrower dtype buys √(bytes-ratio)× more samples at equal memory.**
Holding the matrix at ~80 GB (born on device), the reachable n grows as the
element shrinks; MST time is ~flat because it is the same bytes scanned:

| dtype | n at ~80 GB | pairwise build | GPU Borůvka MST | edges |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| f64 | 100000 | 27.6 s | 3.42 s | 99999/99999 |
| f32 | 141000 | 38.0 s | 3.94 s | 140999/140999 |
| f16 | **200000** | 76.5 s | 3.55 s | 199999/199999 |

**n = 200000 is a dense VAT MST over 40 billion pairwise dissimilarities in
3.5 s** — 2× the samples of the f64 ceiling at the same 80 GB, and far past any
discrete GPU. In the shared 128 GB pool the ceilings rise further still
(f16 reaches n ≈ 250k for the matrix alone).

## Closing the VAT loop on the device (order + iVAT image on the GPU)

The MST was already on the device, but the two remaining VAT stages still ran on
the host, forcing the (up to 80 GB) matrix back across the bus. Both are now on
the GPU (`experiments/gpu_vat.py`), so the whole pipeline
(distances → MST → order → iVAT image) is device-resident and only O(n) scalars
ever touch the host.

- **VAT order** is a heap traversal of the *MST tree*, which reads only MST edge
  weights — O(n) values, not the matrix. The seed (device `argmax`) and the edge
  weights (device gather at the MST edges) are read on the GPU; the light
  O(n log n) traversal runs on the host over those O(n) scalars. The n×n matrix
  never leaves the device for ordering.

- **iVAT image** is the O(n²) reorder + minimax recurrence — the stage that
  forced the whole matrix onto the host. The recurrence *looks* strictly serial
  (row r reads rows < r), but each row's pivot `h_r = min_{c<r} V[r,c]` and
  `jj_r = argmin` reads only the **original** reordered distances (earlier rows
  never overwrite row r before it is processed). So all (h_r, jj_r) are computed
  in **one parallel pass**; only the max-propagation
  `V[r,c] = max(h_r, V[parent,c])` keeps the serial-in-r dependency (one small
  launch per row). Output is **bit-identical** to the numba reference at f64
  (`max|GPU−CPU| = 0.0`, order_match 1.0000).

**iVAT stage — on-device beats the host engine and stays resident:**

| n | CPU `compute_ivat_c` | GPU iVAT f64 | GPU iVAT f32 | f32 speedup |
|-------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 8000 | 434 | 191 | 155 | 2.8× |
| 16000 | 1699 | 704 | 401 | 4.2× |
| 32000 | 7440 | 3482 | 1529 | **4.9×** |

**End-to-end (X on host → iVAT image on host), closing the loop removes the
round-trip.** The device-resident path (f32 distances born on device, GPU iVAT,
image copied to host once) vs the old split (GPU MST, then the n×n matrix copied
back for the host iVAT):

| n | device-resident | GPU MST + host iVAT | speedup |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|---------|
| 8000 | 396 | 739 | 1.9× |
| 16000 | 1209 | 2605 | 2.2× |
| 32000 | 4616 | 12724 | **2.8×** |

(The device path carries fixed warm-up/managed-page overhead that dominates
below n≈8000; the win grows with n as the removed O(n²) round-trip and the
faster on-device iVAT take over.)

![pipeline](../figures/gpu_vat_pipeline.png)

## Scale ceilings on the 128 GB pool

With the whole pipeline on the device, the limit is how many `n×n` buffers the
shared pool holds:

- **MST only** needs one matrix. f16 reaches **n = 200000** (80 GB), MST in
  3.4 s. n = 224000 (100 GB) is **OOM-killed** at build time — not by the MST
  kernel but by the born-on-device pairwise builder, whose f64 tile
  intermediates stack on top of the 100 GB matrix and managed overcommit tips
  past physical RAM. (A pre-built or lower-precision-tiled matrix would push the
  MST ceiling toward ~250k.)

- **Full iVAT image** needs two matrices (D + the image V). With D at f16 and V
  at f32 (6·n² bytes) the whole device-resident pipeline runs at:

  | n | D + V | prep (dist+MST+order) | GPU iVAT | peak used |
  |--------|--------|-----------------------|----------|-----------|
  | 65536 | 25.8 GB | 7.6 s | 7.2 s | 37 GB |
  | 100000 | 60.0 GB | 13.0 s | 15.9 s | 75 GB |

  **n = 100000 is a 10-billion-entry iVAT image built end-to-end on the GPU,
  never touching host memory**; the ceiling for this configuration is ≈140k
  (6·n² ≤ ~120 GB).

**Optimization frontier.** The on-device iVAT issues one kernel launch per row
(the serial-in-r max-propagation), so at n = 100k its ~15.9 s is dominated by
100k Python-level launches, not GPU compute. Folding the row loop into a single
cooperative-groups kernel (grid-wide sync between rows) would remove that Python
overhead and is the next lever for the iVAT stage at extreme n.

## Verdict

- **Exactness:** Borůvka-MST VAT is provably and empirically identical to serial
  Prim VAT (contrast the O(n³) `(min,max)` closure, which was exact but hopeless).
- **Speed:** the **device-resident GPU Borůvka is a real ~5× MST-build win** that
  holds up as n grows. On the CPU, Borůvka is only a modest, eroding win.
- **The one condition:** the distance matrix must already be **on the GPU** — the
  host→device transfer of the `n×n` matrix erases the gain. This is precisely
  satisfied by a **fully on-device VAT front-end**: compute distances on the GPU
  (`tribbleclustering.gpu.pairwise_distances_gpu` already does this, tiled) and
  hand the *resident* matrix straight to GPU Borůvka, never copying it to host.
- **Recommendation:** promote GPU Borůvka to a real feature *as part of* an
  end-to-end on-device VAT path (distances → MST → order on the GPU, only the
  small permutation/labels returning to host). The MST portion then runs ~5×
  faster with bit-identical output. The remaining O(n²) iVAT gather/recurrence
  can follow the same on-device route later.
